It is divided into two subsections.\n\n::: {.incremental}\n-Mortality\n-Weather\n:::\n\n3. ***Methodology*** -- includes a rough description of the methodology we use to estimate the effect of extreme temperatures on mortality \n\n4. ***Results*** -- presents and discusses the main results of the research project. \n\n\n# Replication\n\nAll the raw files needed to run the code are in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ywyo9ynmf5hu6vmi57n1s/h?dl=0&rlkey=4lqqq2m4w5t03iqks1ylbbe5r)\n\nIf you want to replicate the study:\n\nDownload all files of the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ywyo9ynmf5hu6vmi57n1s/h?dl=0&rlkey=4lqqq2m4w5t03iqks1ylbbe5r) while considering your computer space constraints.[^1] \n\nThe files in the repository have a folder-like structure with the following key sections:\n\n[^1]: I recommend downloading the files to an external hard drive to avoid memory issues\n\n1.  **01_RawData** -- Includes the raw data obtained from the New York State Department of Education, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, The Environmental Protection Agency, and the USA Census Buro.\n\n2.  **02_GenData** -- Contains the cleaned version of the raw data-files I use throughout the study.\n\n3.  **03_scripts** -- Includes all the R-scripts I use to transform the raw data into a useful format, perform descriptive statistics, and run my empirical specifications.
