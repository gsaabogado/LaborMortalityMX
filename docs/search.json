    "text": "Mortality\n\n\n\nWe obtain mortality data from the Mexican National Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI). The data contains the state, county, date, and time of the event, as well as additional variables like gender, age, employment status, occupation, education, nationality, marital status, cause of death (i.e. ICD code), type of medical assistance, place of death, who certified the death, if the person died during working hours, and whether the event was pregnancy related. The data set contains more than ten million observations across 34 variables and comes from the administrative records of 2,400 municipalities covering the period between January 1998 and December 2017. Table 1 contains a series of identifiers concerning the life event. It includes the date and hour of death, the municipality id (agem), and the ICD10 written by the person who certified the life event.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Identifiers of the life event \n \n  \n    date \n    hour \n    agem \n    StateName \n    CountyName \n    icd \n  \n \n\n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    1 \n    08021 \n    Chihuahua \n    Delicias \n    J181 \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    5 \n    18017 \n    Nayarit \n    Tepic \n    I679 \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    9 \n    12062 \n    Guerrero \n    Tlacoachistlahuaca \n    C55X \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    0 \n    23004 \n    Quintana Roo \n    Othón P.

INEGI required administrative units to record the employment status at the time of death from 2012. The unknown option occurs when the administrative unit ignores the employment status of the person and the kids option applies to children younger than five. age refers to the age in years of the diseased. We round the age to zero for kids under one. married can take four values; single, NotSingle, unknown, and kids. In this context, kids are persons younger than twelve. educ is the education level of the deseased Note that the classification of educational attainment differs from the period between 1998-2012 and 2013-2017 (see Table 6). job refers to the occupation of the person at the time of the life-event. As with educ, the occupation categories differ for all years before and after 2012 (see Table 7).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Socio-demographic characteristics of the deseased \n \n  \n    date \n    hour \n    unemployment \n    age \n    married \n    EducEnglish \n    JobEnglish \n  \n \n\n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    1 \n    NA \n    42 \n    NotSingle \n    Complete\nprimary school \n    Does not work \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    5 \n    NA \n    85 \n    NotSingle \n    Complete\nprimary school \n    Does not work \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    9 \n    NA \n    35 \n    NotSingle \n    Less than\n3 years of\nprimary school \n    Workers in\nagricultural,\nlivestock,\nhunting\nand fishing\nactivities \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    0 \n    NA \n    NA \n    unknown \n    Not specified \n    Not specified \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    7 \n    NA \n    87 \n    NotSingle \n    Less than\n3 years of\nprimary school \n    Workers in\nagricultural,\nlivestock,\nhunting\nand fishing\nactivities \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    NA \n    NA \n    66 \n    single \n    Not specified \n    Not specified \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3 presents characteristics of the life-event. WorkDeath is an indicator variable equal to WorkDeath if the person died because of work-related activities, NoWorkDeath if the person died at work from natural causes, NaturalDeath when the person died from natural causes outside work, and Unknown AccidentPlaceEnglish and DeathPlaceEnglish indicate the place of death in case of accidents and natural deaths. As with the education and occupation identifiers, the place identifiers also differ after 2012.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Characteristics of the life event \n \n  \n    date \n    hour \n    WorkDeath \n    AccidentPlaceEnglish \n    DeathPlaceEnglish \n  \n \n\n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    1 \n    unknown \n    Unspecified \n    Public Medical Unit \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    5 \n    unknown \n    Unspecified \n    Public Medical Unit \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    9 \n    NaturalDeath \n    Natural death does not apply \n    Home \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    0 \n    NaturalDeath \n    Natural death does not apply \n    Unknown \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    7 \n    NaturalDeath \n    Natural death does not apply \n    Other Public Unit \n  \n  \n    1998-01-01 \n    NA \n    NaturalDeath \n    Natural death does not apply \n    Unknown \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather\n\n\n\nTemperature data comes from 1,994 automated weather stations administered by the National Water Commission (CONAGUA). Each station has daily measures of precipitation, evaporation, as well as the maximum and minimum temperature for each day between January 1990 and December 2017. Table 4 shows a sample of the raw station data. It contains the station id, its geographical location (lon and lat), the date of observation, precipitation, evaporation, and the maximum and minimum temperature recorded in that day.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4:  Raw weather data \n \n  \n    station \n    lon \n    lat \n    date \n    rain \n    evap \n    max \n    min \n  \n \n\n  \n    203802 \n    -116.908 \n    32.447 \n    1998-01-01 \n    0.0 \n    3.6 \n    25.0 \n    13.0 \n  \n  \n    203802 \n    -116.908 \n    32.447 \n    1998-01-02 \n    1.4 \n    NaN \n    18.5 \n    10.0 \n  \n  \n    203802 \n    -116.908 \n    32.447 \n    1998-01-03 \n    6.5 \n    0.4 \n    17.0 \n    12.0 \n  \n  \n    203802 \n    -116.908 \n    32.447 \n    1998-01-04 \n    3.3 \n    1.2 \n    18.0 \n    11.0 \n  \n  \n    203802 \n    -116.908 \n    32.447 \n    1998-01-05 \n    0.0 \n    2.4 \n    16.0 \n    7.5 \n  \n  \n    203802 \n    -116.908 \n    32.447 \n    1998-01-06 \n    0.0 \n    0.5 \n    18.0 \n    3.5 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo match these weather station data to each county we calculate the distance to the center of each administrative region. For those municipalities within a 200 kilometers radius we obtain daily county values for temperature using inverse distance weighting techniques.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5:  Raw weather data \n \n  \n
